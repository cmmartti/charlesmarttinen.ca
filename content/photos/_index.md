I don’t claim to be a great photographer, just someone who enjoys spotting an interesting shot and the challenge in having it turn out. I have a somewhat nice portable camera (Sony RX100 mk V), but the majority of my photos are taken with my cell phone, in the moment.

Here’s a selection of some of my “good” photos that I’ve taken over the years. These are artistic shots; the photographs I value most have people in them, but I don’t upload those publicly.
