# Web Developer and Graphic Designer

If you like my work and need someone like me, [get in touch](/contact.html).

## About Me

<img class="picture" src="/me_cropped.jpg" alt="Me" style="float: right" />

I completed the Graphic Design Production program at the Georgian College in May 2018. Since then, I have further developed my programming skills through self-directed learning, on top of my previous experience at the Port of Wilmington, Delaware, and earlier forays into programming going back to high school.

To read more about my skills and experience, see my [online résumé](/resume.html) or look through some of the stuff I’ve made below, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmmartti).
