# Web Developer and Graphic Designer

## I like simplifying complexity

<img class="picture" src="/me_cropped.jpg" alt="Me" style="float: right" /> That is, I like making complex interfaces easy to use and understand, while still retaining the capabilities of a complex system.

I primarily design and develop web applications and websites, but I have also done some graphic design, including [re‑designing my city’s transit map](/posts/barrie-transit-map.html).

If you like my work and need someone like me, [get in touch](/contact.html), or check out some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmmartti).

## About Me

Based in the Toronto region (but willing to work remotely), I completed the Graphic Design Production program at the Georgian College in May 2018. Since then, I have further developed my programming skills through full-time self-directed learning, on top of my previous experience at the Port of Wilmington, Delaware, and earlier forays into programming going back to high school.

To read more about my skills and experience, see my [online résumé](/resume.html) or look through some of the stuff I’ve made below.
