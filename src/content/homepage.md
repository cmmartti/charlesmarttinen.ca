# Web Developer and Graphic Designer

## I like simplifying complexity.

That is, I like making complex things easy to use and understand, while still retaining the capabilities of a complex&nbsp;system.

I primarily design and develop web applications and websites, but I have also done some print design, including re‑designing my city's transit&nbsp;map.


### About Me

I live in a medium-sized city near Toronto called Barrie, where I completed the Graphic Design Production program at the Georgian College in May 2018\. Since then, I have further developed my programming skills through full-time self-directed learning, on top of my previous experience at the Port of Wilmington, Delaware, and earlier forays into programming going back to high school. 

To read more about my skills and experience, see my [online&nbsp;résumé](resume.html).
