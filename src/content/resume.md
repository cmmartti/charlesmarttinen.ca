# Résumé

You can download this résumé in PDF format [here](resume.pdf). Thanks for taking a look at it.

## Front-end

On the front-end, I am proficient in modern JavaScript, the DOM, React, semantic HTML, and CSS (with Sass). I enjoy creating custom CSS styles from scratch (like on this site), and I have experience creating fully-accessible custom input elements, like menus and search-ahead dropdowns.

## Back-end

On the back-end, I have used Python, Node, and PHP to create applications and APIs on top of relational databases. At my previous job, using PHP and Symfony Framework, I started the re‑development of the internal inventory system which involved writing high performance SQL queries to interface with a legacy Oracle database.

More recently, I have created a large, open-source GraphQL API for [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) using Python, Django, and [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/), a GraphQL library for Python.
