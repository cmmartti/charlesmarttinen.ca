A scrolling image gallery component for React. Unlike every other image gallery, this one is designed to show multiple images at once, without cropping them. It is not designed to be a cinematic experience, but an alternative to splashing a bunch of images on screen directly.

Each sub-component is independently replaceable, and adding custom styles is easy.
