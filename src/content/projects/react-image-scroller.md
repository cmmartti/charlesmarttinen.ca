(This one, here.)

A simple scrolling image gallery for React. Unlike every other image gallery, this one is designed to show multiple images at once, without cropping them. It is not designed to be a cinematic experience, but rather an alternative to splashing a bunch of images on screen directly. Great for screenshots and other odd-shaped content.
