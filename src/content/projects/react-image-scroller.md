**[Live demo](https://cmmartti.github.io/react-image-scroller/) â€¢ [Source code](https://github.com/cmartti/react-image-scroller)**

Used on this page, a scrolling image gallery component for React. Unlike every other image gallery, this one is designed to show multiple images at once, without cropping them. It is not designed to be a cinematic experience, but an alternative to splashing a bunch of images on screen directly.

Note: this still has a few bugs, but the proof of concept is solid.
