Although just a "portfolio site", I built this website to be as performant and scalable as possible. To that end, it is a static site hooked up to a headless CMS ([Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)) that lets me update it anywhere. I enjoy [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s highly flexible, yet strict nature, so I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to generate a static site at build time.

This site is fully responsive with 100% custom CSS styles. Note the dynamic overflow menu in the navigation bar (on mobile), and the custom scrolling image gallery.
