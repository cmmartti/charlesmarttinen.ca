This project was born out of frustration with the [official map [PDF]](https://www.barrie.ca/Living/Getting%20Around/BarrieTransit/Documents/Barrie-Transit-Network-Map.pdf), which has the right idea but suffers greatly from poor execution, inconsistency, and a general case of ugliness. This re-design takes what the official map got right and corrects what it did poorly in a visually-pleasing manner.

Based on a street grid exported from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/44.3748/-79.6832) and processed in [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net/) before being imported into Adobe Illustrator.
